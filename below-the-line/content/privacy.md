# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 2026*

## The Short Version

mungbeans.io is a simple stock screening tool. We don't require accounts, we don't collect personal information, and we don't sell data to anyone.

## What We Collect

### Analytics

We may use basic analytics (such as Google Analytics) to understand how many people visit the site and which pages are most useful. This data is aggregated and anonymous — we can't identify individual visitors.

### Advertising

We use Google AdSense to display ads on the site. Google may use cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to this or other websites. You can opt out of personalized advertising by visiting [Google's Ad Settings](https://adssettings.google.com/).

### Affiliate Links

Some links on this site (such as brokerage referral links) are affiliate links. If you click one and sign up, we may earn a commission. This doesn't affect the content we show or the stocks we track.

## What We Don't Collect

- No account creation or login
- No email addresses
- No personal financial information
- No tracking across other websites (beyond what Google Analytics/AdSense does as described above)

## Cookies

Cookies on this site come from third-party services (Google Analytics, Google AdSense). We don't set our own cookies. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings.

## Third-Party Services

## Changes

If this policy changes, we'll update the date at the top. Given the simplicity of this site, we don't expect it to change much.
