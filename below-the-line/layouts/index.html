    <!-- Methodology -->
    <section class="methodology">
      <h2>The Methodology</h2>
      <p>
        The 200-week moving average represents roughly 4 years of price history. 
        When a quality stock drops to this level, it often represents a significant 
        buying opportunity—the kind that comes along only a handful of times per decade 
        for any given company.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tool tracks two simple things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Is the stock below its 200-week moving average?</strong> Yes or no.</li>
        <li><strong>Is it approaching or retreating?</strong> Week-over-week direction.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We also show 14-week RSI as a short-term oversold indicator, and historical data 
        on what happened after previous touches.
      </p>
      <p class="methodology-note">
        <strong>This is not financial advice.</strong> A stock being below its 200-week 
        average could mean opportunity—or it could mean the business is deteriorating. 
        Always do your own research.
      </p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is the 200-week moving average?</summary>
        <p>The 200-week moving average (200WMA) is the average closing price of a stock over the last 200 weeks — roughly 4 years. It smooths out short-term volatility and acts as a long-term support level. When a quality stock drops below this line, it often signals a significant buying opportunity that may only occur a handful of times per decade for any given company.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does the below-the-line stock screener work?</summary>
        <p>The screener tracks over 1,700 stocks and checks two things each week: is the stock currently trading below its 200-week moving average, and is it moving toward or away from that line. Stocks are categorized as actionable (5–50% below), deep value (50–70% below), or distressed (70%+ below). Additional signals like RSI, insider buying, and free cash flow trends help identify the strongest opportunities.</p>

        <p>Historically, buying quality stocks near their 200-week moving average has produced strong long-term returns. Our data shows that while 12-month returns from a touch can be modest, 24-month returns are often significantly higher.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What does it mean when insiders buy stock below the 200-week moving average?</summary>
        <p>When corporate insiders — executives, directors, or large shareholders — make significant open-market purchases (over $500K) while the stock is below its 200-week moving average, it can be a strong conviction signal. These insiders have the most detailed knowledge of the company's prospects and are putting their own money at risk, suggesting they believe the stock is undervalued.</p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How often is the stock data updated?</summary>
        <p>Stock data is updated weekly after the Friday market close. The screener recalculates 200-week moving averages, RSI readings, insider buying activity, and free cash flow trends for all tracked stocks. This weekly cadence matches the long-term nature of the strategy — daily fluctuations are noise at this time horizon.</p>
      </details>
      
      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is free cash flow and why does it matter for value investing?</summary>
        <p>Free cash flow (FCF) is the cash a company generates after paying for operations and capital expenditures. It matters because a stock can trade below its 200-week moving average for two very different reasons: temporary market pessimism or genuine business deterioration. Growing free cash flow while below the line suggests the business is actually getting healthier even as the stock price declines — meaning the market may be wrong.</p>
