# About Below The Line

## The Idea

There's a quote often attributed to Charlie Munger:

> "If all you ever did was buy high-quality stocks on the 200-week moving average, you would beat the S&P 500 by a large margin over time. The problem is, few human beings have that kind of discipline."

Whether or not Munger actually said this, the concept is sound: the 200-week moving average represents roughly 4 years of price history. When a quality company's stock drops to this level, it's often a rare event—the kind of opportunity that might come along only a handful of times per decade for any given stock.

## What This Tool Does

Below The Line answers one simple question for each stock:

**Is it below its 200-week moving average? Yes or no.**

We also show:

- **Direction**: Is it approaching the line or moving away?
- **14-Week RSI**: A short-term indicator of oversold conditions
- **Historical Touches**: Every time this stock has touched the 200-week line, and what happened afterward

## What This Tool Doesn't Do

- We don't tell you what to buy
- We don't determine if a stock is "quality" or not
- We don't predict future performance
- We don't provide real-time data (updated weekly on Saturdays)

A stock being below its 200-week average could mean opportunity—or it could mean the business is deteriorating. **Always do your own research.**
